Repository theme: college projects writen in Python 3


## First project: "FourierSeries"
in this project I took 2 different time domain signals, first signal is a hat funciton with a global maximum of 1 
and the second signal is a step function with 1 as the constant value, and than we comput the fourier series of those signals
and plot how those signals can be represented with a fourier series.

libraries used: numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, matplotlib.cm

* first section - defining our time domain and its bounderis.
* second section - defining our hat and step function as explained above.
* third section - computing our fourier series for both the hat and rectangular functions.
